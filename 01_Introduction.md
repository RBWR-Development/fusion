# Nuclear Fusion Game

This game aims around realistic approach to nuclear fusion reaction. The main concepts of the game are based mostly on ITER and DEMO reactor designs. These reactors are not functioning yet in real life but the Fusion game depicts a theoretical thermonuclear plant with 6 GW energy output.
While the main concepts are present in the game all the systems were simplified to fit a more cooperation oriented gameplay rather than to simulate real life operations exactly. 

In this game users are expected to run the tokamak to generate thermal energy which then can be stored and used to power up to four turbines to generate electricity. Economical system is implemented where money earned via selling energy can be spent on buying fuel, plant upgrades, maintenance or salaries to gain points.

There are four roles defined in the game - observers, trainees, operators and a supervisor. The first user on a server becomes the supervisor and can make all the important decisions. Other users join as observers and can be promoted by the supervisor. Trainees have limited access to some controls while operators can operate all the devices. Trainees and operators can also vote for certain things or can even remove supervisor from his role if they are not satisfied about his work.

On private servers game can also be played in Sandbox mode, where all upgrades are available and there is no economy, but points can't be gained. It is intended as a training place to test different plant configurations.
